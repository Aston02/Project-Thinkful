    <section>
      <h2 class="border-top">About Steve</h2>
        <p>I am a lover of art, literature and music. I love travelling, seeing new places and trying new cuisines. Studying French language was my passport to the world and and avenue of seeing beyond my nose. After graduating uni, I thought French classes for beginners in schools and French institute before moving into software engineering.</p>

				<p>I have always been fascinated about computers and programming but I have not been able to get much out of it in terms of learning, mentoring and building projects. I believe in learning on the worldâ€™s standard in order to be able to compete on an international scale.</p>

        <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier!</p>

        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a partner for a hackathon) please reach out! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
